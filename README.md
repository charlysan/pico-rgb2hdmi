[![Build](https://github.com/charlysan/pico-rgb2hdmi/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&job=build)](https://github.com/charlysan/pico-rgb2hdmi/actions/workflows/build_and_publish.yml)
Raspberry Pico as an RGB Scanner to HDMI Converter

## About the device
The device presents a simplistic approach of using a single generic purpose microcontroller to capture in real time RGB (CSYNC / HVSYNC) signals and to display it in an HDMI output without requiring FPGA chipsets of Single Boards computers with an HDMI diplay.
This system relies on the use of the PIO capabilities of the RP2040, to do dedicated processing of IO signals enabled with IRQ and DMA capabilites of the processor.

## Methodology
One processor is mostly dedicating to generate HDMI TMDS signals and the other to capture trigger captures and render on screen information among other functionalities.
PIO + DMA are used to dedicate the capture without requiring CPU intervention and to send the TMDS frames to the HDMI diplay.

# PCB
You can build yourself the PCB out of the gerber in HW section, if you wan you can buy it in [pbcway pico-rgb2hdmi](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/pico_RGB_2_HDMI_3b12cb39.html)

# Setup
- Download the pico-sdk, pico-extras, and pico-playground repositories
- Define PICO_SDK_PATH in your ~/.bashrcâ€¢ 
- Download the pico-sdk repository

# Security
Install sha3sum to hash the binary

## Mac
```
brew install md5sha1sum
```

## Local sha3sum usage for sha256
```
sha1sum <file>
echo -n "<device_salt><device_uid>" | sha1sum -b
```
## Tools
Tools were developed for sake of simplicity, focus is on firmware. 
It is required to install python3, pip and the following packages

```
pip install pyserial numpy pillow pyinstaller
```

## converting CSV captures from serial port to images
```
python3 csv2png.py image.csv
```
This generates as output image.png

## Using packtiles to generate include headers from images

./packtiles -s -f r1 char_c64_lineal.png font_c64.h

## Using packtiles to generate sprites
./packtiles -sdf rgab5515 -m  images/commodore.png cbm.h

## Running the python gui app
```
python .\rgb2hdmiGui.py
```

## Packaging the python app as a native app
```
pyinstaller -w -F rgb2hdmiGui.py
```

# Build
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
Go to the specific folder and

`make -j4`

# Visual Studio Code integration
Install the extensions as explained in the  [Pico Getting started manual](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)

Or just download [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and add the following extension

```
code --install-extension marus25.cortex-debug
code --install-extension ms-vscode.cmake-tools
code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools
```

# Debug
Install open ocd as explained in the [Pico Getting started manual section Installing OpenOCD](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)

#Using Pico probe
On the same document check **Appendix A: Using Picoprobe**

Open deploy and run
```
openocd -f interface/picoprobe.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "program <specific elf file> verify reset exit"
```

# Read RP2040 to uf2
```
picotool save -a pico_rgb2hdmi_xyz.uf2
```
